This repository provides the source code for a TypeScript standard library (stdlib), designed to offer a robust and reusable set of utility functions, type helpers, and abstractions for everyday development tasks.

The goal of this library is to centralize common logic and patterns used across TypeScript projects—improving consistency, reducing duplication, and ensuring strong type safety. It is structured to be modular, so individual modules can be imported as needed without adding unnecessary overhead.

Key features include:
- Utility functions for working with arrays, objects, strings, and more
- Common type definitions and generic helpers
- Functional programming helpers
- Lightweight and dependency-free design
- Fully typed and optimized for TypeScript's strict mode

This stdlib serves as a foundational toolkit for building scalable and maintainable TypeScript applications. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
